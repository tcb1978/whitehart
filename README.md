A microsite with contact form that I made for a client built with Express.

I don't expect anyone would want to clone this (I mean, feel free and all that). Mainly this exists to show the responsive layout work that it contains. So some things to note:

- there are six separate possible resolutions. 3 for desktop clients, 3 for mobile clients
- the mobile UI contains a swipeable slide show
- the desktop UI uses a pretty cool animation to transition between frames
